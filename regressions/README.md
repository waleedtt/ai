## Regressions
* Simple Linear Regression

A statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables
y= b0 + b1X
dependent variable = y-intercept(constant) + slope coefficient independent

* Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that is used to predict the outcome of a variable based on the value of two or more variables. It is sometimes known simply as multiple regression, and it is an extension of linear regression. The variable that we want to predict is known as the dependent variable, while the variables we use to predict the value of the dependent variable are known as independent or explanatory variables.
Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2
